# Machine Learning Project - Supervised Learning(Regression)
## Yes Bank Stock Price Prediction ML Project 
Yes bank is an well knwon bank in india which provides wide range of serivce and solutions right from bank accounts, deposits, card, cash managements, privillages banking trade finances, Non-Resident india (NRI) banking, institutionals banking, acquiring, digital banking and agriculture baning solutins. as the date is all about the stock price. So, in the project will be analying pattern of the dataset by performacing exploratory data analysis and try to build a model with help of meching learning for predicting the costing stock price.

The tools for data analysis and model building used in this project are the packages fron the python libaray as Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn, linear Regression, lasso ridges, ElasticNet, minmaxscaler etc.

The dataset contains stock price informations in the various columns by monthly date. There are 5 columns in the dataset such as date open, high, low, closing price. our target variable here is the closing price columns which we wiil try to predict for future. So, first we will perform some exploratory data analysis to the data, try find out the same pattern as well as see the relations between the various columns and the target value column. Then we will be building a model through we will be able to predict or provide a decent estimate of the clossing price which is our target variable.
